## Integration with Website

### Dynamic Member Display
Members added through the dashboard will automatically appear on the team page under their respective session year sections.

### Dynamic Event Display

- All events will be displayed on the events page with proper filtering

### Contact Form Integration
The contact form on the website automatically submits to the backend and appears in the admin dashboard.

## Security Considerations

- File upload validation (images only, 5MB limit)
- SQL injection prevention with parameterized queries
- CORS configuration for API access
- Input validation and sanitization

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Database Connection Error**
   - Verify MySQL is running
   - Check database credentials in `config.env`
   - Ensure database `acm_dashboard` exists

2. **File Upload Issues**
   - Ensure `uploads/` directory exists and is writable
   - Check file size (max 5MB)
   - Verify file type (images only)

3. **CORS Errors**
   - Ensure the frontend is accessing the correct API URL
   - Check that the server is running on the expected port

### Development Tips

- Use `npm run dev` for development with auto-restart
- Check browser console for JavaScript errors
- Monitor server logs for backend issues
- Use browser dev tools to inspect API requests
